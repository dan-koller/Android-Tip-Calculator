# Android Tip Calculator

This is a simple tip calculator app for Android. The app was created following the
corresponding [JetBrains Academy track](https://hyperskill.org/projects/158). I chose this project
in order to learn more about Android development with Kotlin.

## Features

The app is fairly simple as it is my first Android app. You can enter a bill amount and calculate
the tip by sliding the tip percentage.

## Installation

The app is not yet available on the Google Play Store. You need to build the app yourself. You can
do this by cloning the repository and building the app with Android Studio.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dan-koller/Android-Tip-Calculator
```

_Note that the app targets Android 12 (API level 32). The minimum SDK version is 29 (Android 10)._

## Technologies

The app is written in Kotlin and uses the Android SDK. Testing is done with Roboelectric and JUnit.
